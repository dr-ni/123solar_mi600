* This program (deye-logger) is needed in connection with 123solar to query *
* inverter data from Deye micro inverters of the Deye SUNXXXX family via    *
* encapsulated MODBUS calls for 123solar protocol script deye-sun-mi.php.   *
*                                                                           *

To compile this program you need an installed gnu c++ compiler on your system.
For an easy way of installation you can follow the steps listed below. These 
steps are based on an raspberry OS system:

1. install the gnu C++ compiler (if not already done)
  
   $ sudo apt-get install g++
  
2. copy the program source to /usr/local/src/deye-logger

   $ mkdir /usr/local/src/deye-logger
   $ cd /usr/local/src/deye-logger
   $ cp ???/123solar/misc/tools/deye-logger/* .
  
3. compile the program

   $ make all 

4. if there are no errors, install the programm to /usr/bin

   $ make install
  
5. check if the program deye-logger is starting without problems

   $ /usr/bin/deye-logger
  
   now you can see all command line parameters on the screen
   including their description
  
6. you need to know the IP-Address of the inverter in your network
   you have to change the IP 192.168.1.123 in the example below with the
   inverter IP in you network!

  $ /usr/bin/deye-logger -c 192.168.1.123 -i
  
7. If there are no errors shown on the screen now you can see all gathered
   information of the inverter in a status file /tmp/deye-logger/your_ip.status
   and on the screen

8. copy the LoggerSerialNumber from the status file or screen into the clipboard.
   this number should have 10 digits and starts with 41......
  
9. go to the 123solar web-if and chose protocol deye-sun-mi for your adapter.
   than type the literal lsn= and after that literal paste the previosly copied 
   logger serial into field 'Communication options' in Admin -> Inverter(s) 
   configuration

If all these steps are done you should now see all possible inverter
data in the detail screen of 123solar. Please keep in mind that the program
deye-logger has always to be active in background while 123solar is running.
You can start the program at system bootup i.e. by an entry in your
/etc/rc.local script.

the sequence in the file rc.local could look like this:

/usr/bin/deye-logger -c 192.168.1.123 -i
/usr/bin/curl http://localhost/123solar/scripts/boot123s.php
